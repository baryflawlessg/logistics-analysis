# Quick Setup Guide - Delivery Failure Analysis System

## üöÄ Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Verify Python Installation
```bash
python --version
```
*Should show Python 3.7 or higher*

### Step 2: Run the Demo
```bash
python simple_demo.py
```

### Step 3: Try Interactive Mode
```bash
python simple_demo.py --interactive
```

### Step 4: Review Results
Check the generated JSON files in your folder for detailed analysis results.

## üìÅ Files You Have

### Core Program Files
- `simple_delivery_analyzer.py` - Main analysis engine
- `simple_demo.py` - Demo script
- `README.md` - Complete documentation

### Documentation
- `Delivery_Failure_Analysis_Solution.md` - Detailed solution approach
- `Solution_Architecture_Diagram.md` - System architecture
- `Complete_Solution_Summary.md` - Assignment completion summary

### Sample Data
- `sample-files/` folder with your CSV data files

### Generated Outputs
- `use_case_1_chennai_delays.json` - City analysis results
- `use_case_2_client_failures.json` - Client analysis results
- `use_case_3_warehouse_performance.json` - Warehouse analysis results
- `use_case_4_city_comparison.json` - City comparison results
- `use_case_5_festival_risks.json` - Festival risk analysis results
- `use_case_6_scaling_risks.json` - Scaling risk assessment results
- `delivery_analysis.db` - SQLite database with all data

## üéØ What Each Use Case Does

1. **City Delays**: Analyzes why deliveries fail in specific cities
2. **Client Failures**: Identifies patterns in client-specific order failures
3. **Warehouse Performance**: Evaluates warehouse efficiency and bottlenecks
4. **City Comparison**: Compares performance between different cities
5. **Festival Risks**: Predicts risks during holiday/festival periods
6. **Scaling Risks**: Assesses impact of business growth on operations

## üîß Customization Examples

### Analyze Different Cities
```python
from simple_delivery_analyzer import SimpleDeliveryAnalyzer

analyzer = SimpleDeliveryAnalyzer()
analyzer.load_all_data()

# Analyze Delhi instead of Chennai
result = analyzer.analyze_city_delays("Delhi")
print(result)
```

### Analyze Different Time Periods
```python
# Look back 30 days instead of 7
result = analyzer.analyze_client_failures("Mann Group", 30)
print(result)
```

### Compare Different Cities
```python
# Compare Delhi vs Mumbai
result = analyzer.compare_city_performance("Delhi", "Mumbai", 60)
print(result)
```

## üìä Understanding the Output

### Key Metrics
- **Total Orders**: Number of orders analyzed
- **Failed Orders**: Number of failed deliveries
- **Failure Rate**: Percentage of failed deliveries
- **Insights**: Human-readable explanations
- **Recommendations**: Actionable improvement suggestions

### Sample Insight Format
```json
{
  "total_orders": 45,
  "failed_orders": 8,
  "failure_rate": 17.8,
  "insights": [
    "Primary failure reason: Stockout",
    "Warehouse inventory management needs improvement"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement real-time inventory tracking",
    "Deploy dynamic routing software"
  ]
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'pandas'" Error
- **Solution**: Use `simple_delivery_analyzer.py` instead of `delivery_failure_analyzer.py`
- **Reason**: Simple version uses only built-in Python libraries

### "No orders found" Error
- **Check**: Your sample data has limited records
- **Solution**: This is normal for sample data - will work with full dataset

### "File not found" Error
- **Check**: `sample-files/` folder exists with CSV files
- **Verify**: File names match exactly (case-sensitive)

## üé• For Your Video Demo

### Suggested Demo Script
1. **Show the problem**: Explain delivery failure challenges
2. **Run the demo**: `python simple_demo.py`
3. **Show results**: Open JSON files and explain insights
4. **Try interactive mode**: `python simple_demo.py --interactive`
5. **Explain scaling**: How it works with full dataset

### Key Points to Highlight
- **No external dependencies** required
- **Works with your sample data** immediately
- **Scales to full dataset** easily
- **Provides actionable insights** and recommendations
- **Covers all 6 use cases** from your assignment
